  "summary": "The BuildRequest REQ-1 requests clarification of what changes need to be made to A2Z Recharge, but does not specify actual implementation requirements. The diff only adds a tracking entry in project_state.json marking REQ-1 as 'pending' - no actual changes to the A2Z Recharge application have been implemented. Since REQ-1 is a meta-requirement requesting specification rather than implementation, and the diff appropriately reflects this pending state, there are no missing requirements or hallucinated features.",
